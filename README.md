# Covid-SQL-Analysis
This project analyzes global COVID-19 data using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). It combines data from two Excel files — one with COVID-19 cases and deaths, and another with vaccination progress — to extract meaningful insights such as infection rates, death rates, and vaccination percentages by country.
